### Semester Project

This webpage is a blog based on my cat Foxy.
The navigation bar will be linked to each page so that you can navigate to each page of your liking.

______________________
#### DISCLAIMER:
Flask doesn't run my page properly even after I properly link folders with: {{url_for('static', filename='file.css')}}

And, html doesn't appear as it's supposed to in general when ran under VSCode.

Demo will be performed on PyCharm just, so you can see how the webpage is supposed to look.
